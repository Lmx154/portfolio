              description="This project was made as a gateway to understand the challenges associated with gathering realtime telemetry. This was brought about by my joining of the UTRGV Rocket Launchers. When I joined, there was no way to test whether or not my changes would break the Telemetry software, so using my knowledge gained from my Software Engineering course, I created a testing module that simulated a rocket launch. I used this to test my new features and add to the existing software. I also used this testing module to create a whole new telemetry gathering software named TDAS that utilized newer tools. I used CircuitPython to create a simple rocket to ground station simulation. "

              description="This project was made to address the limitations of the existing TAS-GUI used for telemetry visualization in the UTRGV Rocket Launchers. The existing TAS-GUI was using older tools and was riddled with bugs that came about from deprecated dependencies. This made it a challenge to add new features. I used this as an opportunity to learn new tools and create a new telemetry visualization software that was more stable and easier to use, and created a more efficient and user friendly way of storing telemetry data. I used Tauri 2.0 for its similarity to the existing TAS-GUI, and because of my familiarity with full-stack development. Using Tauri also allowed me to leverage the customizibility of JavaScript and React, coupled with the performance of Rust at the backend. I created all performance and latency sensitive features in Rust, and used JavaScript and React only for UI and data visualization. In Rust I created functions to open, close and list serial ports. I also made sure to include data parsing and file creation into the backend to minimize overhead that was present in the original TAS-GUI. "

After being introduced to Tailwind CSS by my collegues, I found that the amount of time saved during development was significant and therfore, decided to implement it here.
